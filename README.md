# LlamaDB

### Fair warning: this project is not maintained. 
Do not use this for anything important, like... for anything. This is a database I wrote for the fun of it. It will never be production-ready.

LlamaDB is a simple SQL database, written entirely in the Rust programming language.

## Building

LlamaDB is built using the nightly builds of Rust and Cargo.
For installation instructions, go to http://www.rust-lang.org.

To use the CLI, navigate to the `cli/` directory and run `cargo run`.
You'll be greeted by the friendly `llamadb> ` prompt, with whom you can enter SQL queries.
To exit the CLI, press `Ctrl+D`.


## Examples, Features and TODO

## About

I started this mostly as a learning project so that I could learn SQL and its
implementation details better. This project may or may not go anywhere; we'll just have to see.

The other reason I started this was to see how the Rust programming language
could be used to write large projects such as SQL databases.
So far, I think it's working out fairly well. :)


## Special thanks

A **HUGE THANKS** goes out to SQLite and the SQLite documentation.
Their wonderful docs helped shed some light on the SQL syntax and other crucial
details such as their B-Tree implementation.
